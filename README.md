# Deloitte-HDSI-Program
Analysis of employment trends over the COVID-19 Pandemic 

This project is a part of my training in a data science mentorship program partnership between Deloitte and the Halicioglu Data Science Institute.

P.S. This project was my first venture into doing data analysis in a real-world application during my Freshman year. I know this repo is a bit hard to follow
since there are errors and mostly minimally commented code. It will stay like so because I appreciate where I started, thank you for your understanding!
